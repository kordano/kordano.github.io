I'm CEO and data engineer at [lambdaforge](http://lambdaforge.io), a consultancy specialized in **information system engineering** based in Heidelberg, Germany.  

My primary focus lies on designing useful **data models** and robust **system architectures** with simple **deployment solutions**, chosing the best **databases** for the tasks, and building lightweight and secure **web APIs** for mobile and web clients.   

As a freelancer I've helped clients building their products by creating **React** and **Android** applications with **Javascript**, **ClojureScript** and **Kotlin**, by building server systems in **JavaScript**, **Java**, **Clojure** or **Go** with databases like **Postgres**, **Redis**, **Datomic** or **CouchDB**, and by maintaining their systems using **Linux** and **Docker**.   

With ten years of experience as a developer I'm deeply invested in the open source community. I co-authored of some Clojure libraries from the [replikativ](https://github.com/replikativ) stack, such as replikativ or datahike.
